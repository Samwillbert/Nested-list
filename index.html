		<h1>Water on the Earth</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H<sub>2</sub>O) and is vital for all known forms of life.
		 Water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has <Strong>a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam</strong>. 
		 Water covers <em>71%</em> of the Earth's surface. 
		 it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with<strong> 1.6%</strong> of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation.
		<mark> Oceans hold 97% of surface water</mark>, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.</P>
		
		
		<h2>Oceans:</H2>
		<p>An ocean is a major body of <u>saline water</u>, and a principal component of the hydrosphere. 
		Approximately <strong>71% of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean</strong>, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. 
		More than half of this area is over <b>3,000 meters(9,800 feet)</b> deep.
		Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand, and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of<del> 32 to 36 </del> 30 to 38 ppt.

		<h2>Lakes:</h2>
		<p>A lake<span>(from Latin word <i>lacus</i>)</span> is a terrain feature, <s>a body</s> of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin and moves slowly if it moves at all.
		On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.
		
		<h2>Ponds:</h2>
		<p>A <b>pond</b> is a body of standing water, either natural or human-made, that is usually smaller than a lake.
		 A wide variety of human-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy.</p>
		
		<h2>Rivers</h2>
		<p>A river is a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water.
		one example is <em>Burn</em> in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.</p>
